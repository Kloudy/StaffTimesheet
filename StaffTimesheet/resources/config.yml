                          #Why this is important: 
                          #If an admin searches for logs for a staff member in range of year 2016 through year 5000, the plugin would loop
                          #through all the days in this range and collect all the logs. This would be very slow.
                          #This value ensures that the plugin will search at most a certain number of days regardless of the range input by the admin
